# Target-email-marketing
This project will go through the CRISP-DM steps, making use of the data that Universal Plus provided to determine the most suitable model by comparison and evaluation, which is of great significance to enhance the efficiency of marketing with lower cost.
From the modelling part, SVM, RF, LR, DT and two optimisation models of SVM and DT are applied to make a prediction. In the evaluation part, we use AUC-ROC curve, Gain chart, F1-score, FRP, accuracy from Confusion Matrix to evaluate the models and RF under the over-sampling method shows the best result when considering all these metrics. And we use this model to find the three variables that were most correlated with the target variable: Email segment, recency and zip area. In addition, our visual analysis of these three variables using tableau led to one conclusion: Suggested keywords to identify target groups could be male, 1-3 months since last purchase and suburban and urban areas.
